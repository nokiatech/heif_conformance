# High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) Conformance File Candidates
This repository contains file candidates for High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) conformance testing. The files are generated using the HEIF source code available **[here](https://github.com/nokiatech/heif)**

The descriptions of the bitstreams and the files can be found in **[conformance_file_descriptions.xlsx](https://github.com/nokiatech/heif_conformance/blob/master/conformance_file_descriptions.xlsx)** file.

(NOTE: Access to the link requires MPEG membership) HEIF conformance files related MPEG contribution can be found **[here](http://phenix.int-evry.fr/mpeg/doc_end_user/current_document.php?id=54404&id_meeting=166)**

In addition to HEIF conformance files, this branch contains also MIAF conformance file candidates and input bitstreams used while generating those.

## Contents of the Repository:
This repository contains the following directories:
* \bitstreams: Various HEVC encoded bitstreams to be used in the conformance files
* \configurations: Configuration files which were used to generate the HEIF conformance files.
* \conformance_files: HEIF conformance files 

# Note: 
Conformance file candidates are subject to change based on test results or new files can be added to the repository for additional conformance testing. Please make sure that you keep your local files up-to-date.
